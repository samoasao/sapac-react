    100 minutes, 26 performers, 16 stories and 1 pandemic. Jason Robert Brown
    wrote the music and lyrics to these songs with a common theme...how one
    moment can change our lives forever. Join us as we have gathered performers
    from all over the country to convey a modern interpretation to these
    classNameic songs by relating them to our current pandemic. Proceeds from
    this performance will go to the Tucson Performing Arts fund which was
    developed to help local artists financially during this time.
