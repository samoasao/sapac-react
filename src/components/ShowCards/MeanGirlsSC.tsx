      Cady Heron may have grown up on an African savanna, but nothing prepared
      her for the wild and vicious ways of her strange new home: suburban
      Illinois. How will this na√Øve newbie rise to the top of the popularity
      pecking order? By taking on The Plastics, a trio of lionized frenemies led
      by the charming but ruthless Regina George. But when Cady and her friends
      devise a "Revenge Party" to end Regina's reign, she learns the hard way
      that you can't cross a Queen Bee without getting stung.

      Adapted from Fey's hit 2004 film, Mean Girls was nominated for a
      staggering 12 Tony Awards. This queen-bee took Broadway by storm and has
