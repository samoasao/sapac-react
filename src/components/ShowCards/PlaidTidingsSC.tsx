      <em>Forever Plaid: Plaid Tidings</em> is a brand new show that offers the
      best of Forever Plaid, tied up in a nifty package with a big Christmas bow
      on top! Filled with Christmas standards that have all been "Plaid-erized,"
      our boys are back to do their Christmas Special.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Frankie, Jinx, Smudge and Sparky aren't sure why they've
      returned to Earth for another posthumous performance, but a phone call
      from the heavenly Rosemary Clooney lets them know that they're needed to
      put a little harmony into a discordant world. Sprinkled among the
      Christmas offerings are audience favorites, like their riotous
      three-minute-and-eleven-second version of The Ed Sullivan Show â€“ this
      time, featuring the Rockettes, the Chipmunks and The Vienna Boys Choir, as
      well as a Plaid Caribbean Christmas that puts the "Day-O" in Excelsis!
    </p>
    <p>
      This truly "heaven-sent" holiday treat will lift audiences' spirits and
      fill them with nostalgia for a bygone era of classic music sung in perfect
      harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cast includes the original productions' very talented cast of Xander
      Mason, Topher Esguerra, Liam Boyd and Danny Fapp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put yourself in the holiday mood and see this show that will fill your
      hearts with joy, laughter and music!
