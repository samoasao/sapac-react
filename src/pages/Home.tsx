                    <p><em>Forever Plaid</em> is one of the most popular and successful musicals in recent memory. This
                    deliciously fun revue is chock-full of classic barbershop quartet harmonies and pitch-perfect
                    melodies! Directed by Chach Snook who was on the National Tour of the show as well as Music
                    Directed by Matthew Holter who is a founder of the doo-wop group The 4GENTS, this show
                    will be sure to delight and move audiences!</p>
                    <p>
                        Once upon a time, there were four guys (Sparky, Smudge, Jinx and Frankie) who discovered that
                        they shared a love for music and then got together to become their idols â€“ The Four Freshman,
                        The Hi-Lo&#39;s and The Crew Cuts. Rehearsing in the basement of Smudge&#39;s family&#39;s plumbing
                        supply company, they became &quot;Forever Plaid&quot;. On the way to their first big gig, the &quot;Plaids&quot; are
                        broadsided by a school bus and killed instantly. It is at the moment when their careers and lives
                    end that the story of <em>Forever Plaid</em> begins....
                    </p><p>
                        Singing in close harmony, squabbling boyishly over the smallest intonations and executing their
                        charmingly outlandish choreography with overzealous precision, the &quot;Plaids&quot; are a guaranteed
                        smash, with a program of beloved songs and delightful patter that keeps audiences rolling in the
                    aisles when they&#39;re not humming along to some of the great nostalgic pop hits of the 1950s.</p>
