            <em>Forever Plaid: Plaid Tidings</em> is a brand new show that
            offers the best of Forever Plaid, tied up in a nifty package with a
            big Christmas bow on top! Filled with Christmas standards that have
            all been "Plaid-erized," our boys are back to do their Christmas
            Special.
          </p>

            At first, Frankie, Jinx, Smudge and Sparky aren't sure why they've
            returned to Earth for another posthumous performance, but a phone
            call from the heavenly Rosemary Clooney lets them know that they're
            needed to put a little harmony into a discordant world. Sprinkled
            among the Christmas offerings are audience favorites, like their
            riotous three-minute-and-eleven-second version of The Ed Sullivan
            Show â€“ this time, featuring the Rockettes, the Chipmunks and The
            Vienna Boys Choir, as well as a Plaid Caribbean Christmas that puts
            the "Day-O" in Excelsis!
          </p>
          <p>
            This truly "heaven-sent" holiday treat will lift audiences' spirits
            and fill them with nostalgia for a bygone era of classic music sung
            in perfect harmony.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cast includes the original productions' very talented cast of
            Xander Mason, Topher Esguerra, Liam Boyd and Danny Fapp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Put yourself in the holiday mood and see this show that will fill
            your hearts with joy, laughter and music!
